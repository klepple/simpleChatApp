I wanted to solidify my understanding of sockets and refresh my knowledge of python. The last time I used python I was still
not sure how OOP worked so.... yeah.

Hopefully I will be able to apply my new skills to [this project I started last year](https://github.com/klepple/deCRYPTme) and make it
more interesting.

Next step is being able to transfer files!
